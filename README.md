# Introduction

There are many CI systems out there and even recently more have come on the market. But how do you tell which one will fit your needs? Or has more functionality than your currently using?

Even upon deciding to transition to a new platform the challenge begins of replicating your current workflow.

This book aims to provide you, the reader, that guidance so that transitioning to a new system can be done quicker and be able to determine if the platform doesn't suit your needs sooner.

As there are more CI platforms coming online every day this book aims to be a living document. Providing insight to the most relevant technologies and rotating out those that no longer apply.
